Hello! My name is Thauan. 
— It pronounces like `/thau/ - /one/`. 
My nick is also pronounced like that, the `0x01` in my nick stands for the number 1 in hexadecimal representation, which when you pronounce it in english sounds like the native (🇧🇷 portuguese) pronounciation of my real name 🤯, LOL.

I've been working on Tech for several years and in the last five I've been working on computer security.

— שלום
