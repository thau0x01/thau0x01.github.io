Working on Information Security is sometimes dificult because we face situations that impact our work's result, like scopes and deadlines that make us unable to simulate real threat scenarios. 

Such situations are very bad for everyone, because, if our work is not able to demonstrate the real threat scenario and its impact, the organization we work won't take any actions (💰) to mitigate that risk, and this impacts us, because if we haven't an environment with continuous increasing security maturiy, we'll rust or get obsolete after some time.

Likewise __Sun Tzu__ said in his book __The Art of The War__: 
> “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”

We as red teammers have the responsability to perform attacks like the real enemies, then how can we do it if we don't have the means for doing it?
Red teamers should do the job like the real attacker would do it, obviously, with the purpose to find breaches and then help to fix them.

__The Pirate Ship__ is a reference to the pirates era in the 15th Century, an epoch in which pirates were hired by kings to fight batles they don't wanted or couldn't fight themselves. I mean, __they did what had to be done__. The most famous example of this period is [Sir Francis Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Drake), known as "The Queen's Pirate".

As a red teammer, I think we have some similarities with those ones, because we should do what need to be done, even when it brings up ethical questions (attack vectors, social engineering, and so on). We should find a way to test attack scenarios that our adversary would exploit to achieve it's goal and, sometimes we must do it using the same ways our adversaries would use.   

— It is what it is. Who don't believe this is an accurate way to mitigate security risks, wait until your market competitors brings up products and technologies based on intelectual property you developed. 🙂 

## About Me
Hello! My name is Thauan. 
— It pronounces like `/thau/ - /one/`.   
My nick is also pronounced like that, the `0x01` in my nick stands for the number 1 in hexadecimal representation, and when you pronounce it in english sounds like the native (🇧🇷 portuguese) pronounciation of my real name 🤯.

I've been working on Tech for several years and in the last five I've been working on computer security.   
I like hacking, geopolitics and literatures about military/intelligence works.

— שלום
