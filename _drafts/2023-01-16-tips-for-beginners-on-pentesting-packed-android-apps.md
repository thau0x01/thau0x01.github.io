## Intro
In this post I'll share some learnings I got during a security analysis on an Android App (`.apk`) that has been packed by a security solution.

### What are packers?
Packers are tools that implements security countermeasures on apps/libraries/softwares to prevent users from reverse engineering the app and tampering or modifying its behavior to achieve actions the app wasn't intended to do by it's developer (sometimes developers packs their apps to prevent market competitors from copying on them).   

Softwares that mostly implements this are financial applications like banking and fintech apps, they do this to prevent fraud (or at least they try to).

Today, the most popular packers in the market are AppDome, DexGuard, DexProtector, digital.ai (formerly known as Arxan), etc.

### What packers do?
Packers are mostly known for doing code obfuscation on applications during compilation time, but they don't do only that nowadays.   

Today, packers implement a lot of security countermeasures to protect applications, some of those countermeasures are:
- Code Obfuscation
- Runtime Application Self Protection (RASP) techniques that include
    - Anti Debugging
    - Anti VM
    - Anti Hooking
    - Self Integrity Verifications
- Control Flow Flattening (CFF)
- High entropy covert channel for apps communication.
